# Trainer Desk

A macOS-style trainer dashboard: a dock of app tiles at the bottom, and each app opens in its own draggable, resizable window.

Apps: **Settings**, **My Class**, **Cohorts** (sample data in `app.js`) and **Coaching Compass** (`coaching-compass/`).

Open `index.html` in a browser to run it locally. Coaching Compass needs the Claude artifact runtime to save data, analyze audits and read Google Drive; outside an artifact it runs with nothing saved.

To publish as a Claude artifact, run `python3 build.py` and publish `dist/trainer-desk.html`.

To add an app, add an entry to `APPS` in `app.js`.
